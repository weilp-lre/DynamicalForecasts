# Dynamical.org Datasets Example Notebooks

Python jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of dynamical.org datasets. Browse the dataset catalog at [dynamical.org/catalog](https://dynamical.org/catalog/).


# Getting started

We suggest using `uv` to install python and dependencies in a consistent, isolated way that won't impact any other python installations on your system.

1. Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ (it's a one liner)
2. Run it
   * In your browser: In a terminal run `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab` then follow the link jupyter will print to open these notebooks in your browser.
   * In your editor/IDE: In a terminal run `uv sync` then open this folder in your editor and when asked to select a python interpreter choose `.venv/bin/python` on macOS and Linux, or `.venv\Scripts\python` on Windows.
